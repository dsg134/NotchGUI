The presented notch GUI is an interactive frequency domain filtering app. It allows users to design frequency domain filters with the mouse cursor. The user can manually draw notches on an image's Fourier transform with their mouse and see what happens in the spatial domain as a result.
Included features:
- An SNR test to assess the denoising capabilities of your filter.
- Ability to change the structure of each notch.
- An easy-to-use UI that requires very few button presses.

To launch the app, clone the repo and run NotchGUI.py.
